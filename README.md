# Python
My Python Projects
Basically, this repository contains machine learning programs. Folders ML* are course programming assignment from UW-Madison. Also can be found under UW-Madison repo.

The Unsolved folder is from my friend, I basically put it there, maybe I should find some time to solve. It looks like a EDA.

All Leetcode problems are under Leetcode repo:)
